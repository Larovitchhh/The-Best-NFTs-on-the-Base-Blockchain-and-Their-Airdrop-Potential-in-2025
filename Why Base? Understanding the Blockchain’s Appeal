Base is built on Optimism’s OP Stack and is part of the Superchain ecosystem, enabling seamless interoperability with other Layer 2 solutions. Its low-cost transactions and developer-friendly environment make it an ideal platform for NFT projects, ranging from digital art to gaming and collectibles. Since Base is still in its early stages, active participation in its ecosystem—especially through NFT interactions—could position users for rewards if a native token airdrop is announced.

While Base has not officially confirmed an airdrop, the network has hinted at exploring a native token, with a commitment to involving the community in the process. Historical patterns from other Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism suggest that airdrops often reward users who engage with dApps, trade NFTs, or provide liquidity. With this in mind, let’s dive into the best NFT collections on Base and their potential for airdrop eligibility.
