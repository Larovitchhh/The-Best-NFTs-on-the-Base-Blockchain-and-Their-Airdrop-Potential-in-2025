Overview: Inspired by Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Base Apes is a collection of unique ape-themed NFTs that offer holders access to exclusive events, merchandise, and potential future airdrops within the Base ecosystem. The project emphasizes community building and utility.
Why It’s Popular: Base Apes leverages the popularity of ape-themed NFTs while offering lower entry costs due to Base’s low fees. The collection has seen significant trading volume on marketplaces like OpenSea.
Airdrop Potential: Similar to BAYC’s ApeCoin airdrop, Base Apes could be a candidate for token rewards if the project launches its own governance token. Holding these NFTs and participating in related events or governance discussions could boost airdrop chances.
